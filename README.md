# Business-Risk-Management

We had to create a detailed report performing the ESG analysis of a Companay having a minimum turnover of 50 Cr per year. This project was done under the guidance of Prerna Wadikar(LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/prernaw).
So for the project we took "Prasad Group" as a our comapny for the ESG analysis.

We even had a meeting with the owner of the Business and Shared our detailed analysis to him.
And with the collabrative work of the team we were awarded the highest grade in the course. Thanks to the team members:
